Hi! I am Meena :) 

I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle and am advised by Prof. David McDonald.

Research Interests
======

My research interests are broadly in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. I study if and how AI/ML algorithms are human-centered and challenges involved in using them as design material. I seek to bridge knowledge gaps of non-experts of AI/ML, especially designers and UX practitioners, and develop solutions for better engagement with AI/ML algorithms during the design process.

Hi! I am Meena :) 

I'm a second year PhD student from the [Human-centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) department in University of Washington, Seattle. I am advised by Prof. David McDonald.

Research Interests
======

My research is situated in the intersection of HCI and AI/ML and investigates what it means for AI/ML algorithms to be 'human-centered'. 

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have spurred its deployment and use in a number of wide-ranging applications. However, creating useful and usable applications with AI/ML algorithms still involves numerous challenges. How is AI/ML leveraged as a design material by non-experts, such as designers and other UX professionals in the design process? My work seeks to address this particular challenge and bridge these epistemologies. I focus on conducting **human-centered evaluations** of such algorithms and encapsulating the results in **interactive solutions** that can be used in the design process.

I also hold a Master's degree in Informatics from UC Irvine (where I was advised by Dr. Bonnie Nardi and Dr. Matthew Bietz) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. When I am not doing PhD things, I enjoy reading fiction and cooking Indian food :)

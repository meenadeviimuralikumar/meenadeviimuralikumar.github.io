Hi! I am Meena :) 

I'm a second year PhD student from the [Human-centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) department in University of Washington, Seattle. I am advised by Prof. David McDonald.

Research Interests
======

My research is situated in the intersection of HCI, CSCW, and AI/ML and investigates what it means for AI/ML algorithms to be 'human-centered'. 

Creating useful and usable applications with AI/ML algorithms involves numerous challenges, including enabling designers to leverage AI/ML as a design material. My work seeks to address this challenge by conducting **human-centered evaluations** of such algorithms and encapsulating the results in **interactive solutions** that can be used in the design process. Using a mixed-methods approach, I attempt to identify what an AI/ML algorithm does well and does not do well, especially in different social contexts. I also translate these implications to designers and empirically analyze how the design process and design of the artifact is positively influenced.

Hi! I am Meena :) 

I'm a second year PhD student from the [Human-centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) department in University of Washington, Seattle. I am advised by Prof. David McDonald.

Research Interests
======

My research is broadly situated in the intersection of HCI, CSCW, and AI/ML. 

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have spurred its deployment and use in a number of wide-ranging applications. However, creating useful and usable applications with these algorithms is still a challenge. My work seeks to bridge this gap by 
1) Conducting human-centered evaluations of learning algorithms and 
2) Investigating if and how the design process can be adapted to face the inherent challenges involved in designing with AI/ML.

I also hold a Master's degree in Informatics from UC Irvine (where I was advised by Dr. Bonnie Nardi and Dr. Matthew Bietz) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. When I am not doing PhD things, I enjoy reading fiction and cooking Indian food :)

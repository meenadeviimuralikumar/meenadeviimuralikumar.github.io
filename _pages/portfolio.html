    <h3> Human-centered Evaluation of a Toxicity-detecting Machine Learning Model </h3>
    <p> How can we evaluate an AI/ML model beyond technical metrics such as precision, recall, and so on? 
    How can we provide insights about how this model works in different sociotechnical contexts and scenarios, especially
    to UX professional who design applications on top of such models? This in-progress work addresses these questions by conducting a
      human-centered evaluation of <i>Perspective</i>, a ML tool that can score online comments for toxicity.</p>

      <h3> UW </h3>
        <h4> HCI & Journalism </h4>
          <p>I participated in a Directed Research Group headed by Melinda McClure Haughey and Dr. Kate Starbird. 
          The goal was to analyze data from semi-structured interviews of national and international journalists working on online misinformation and 
          disinformation. We did open coding of the data followed by a thorough qualitative analysis using affinity diagramming. 
          I wrote up memos for the challenges faced by journalists, particularly in using social media platforms, and design implications. This contribution led me to also contribute
            to the CSCW paper Melinda submitted.
